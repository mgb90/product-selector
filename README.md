# product-selector



Task: Create proof of concept of an app designed to help customers select a shirt on a retail website.

Result: A very simple design that makes it easy for customers to apply filters to select shirts. Supervisor was happy with this approach and the project was fleshed out and completed by a more senior developer on a new platform.

The original file product-selector.html has HTML, CSS & JS all in the same file. It was a single asset used on the SFCC platform.
